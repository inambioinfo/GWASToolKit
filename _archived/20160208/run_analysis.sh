### SET SOME VARIABLES
### This part will determine what lines below will be run.

### FOR ANY TYPE OF ANALYSIS
### - Argument #1  indicates whether you want to analyse a list of variants, a region, or do a GWAS [VARIANT/REGION/GWAS].
###                Depending on the choice you additional arguments are expected:
###                - for GWAS: no additional arguments, except the standard 10 arguments in total.
###                - for VARIANT: 2 additional argument, namely a [FILE] containing the list of variants and the chromosome.
###                - for REGION: 3 additional arguments, namely the [CHR], [REGION_START] and [REGION_END] in numerical fashion.
###                - for GENES: 2 additional argument, namely a list of [GENES] and a Â±[RANGE].
### - Argument #2  is input data to use, i.e. where the [imputed] genotypes reside: [1kGp3v5GoNL5/1kGp1v3/GoNL4].
### - Argument #3  is the name of the SNPTEST method used [score/expected].
### - Argument #4  is exclusion-list to be used, can be either:
###                [EXCL_DEFAULT]   * exclusion_nonCEA.list            - excludes all non-CEA samples, THIS IS THE DEFAULT
###                [EXCL_FEMALES]   * exclusion_nonCEA_Females.list    - excludes all non-CEA samples and all females
###                [EXCL_MALES]     * exclusion_nonCEA_Males.list      - excludes all non-CEA samples and all males
###                [EXCL_CKD]       * exclusion_nonCEA_CKD.list        - excludes all non-CEA samples and with CKD
###                [EXCL_NONCKD]    * exclusion_nonCEA_nonCKD.list     - excludes all non-CEA samples and without CKD
###                [EXCL_T2D]       * exclusion_nonCEA_T2D.list        - excludes all non-CEA samples and who have type 2 diabetes
###                [EXCL_NONT2D]    * exclusion_nonCEA_nonT2D.list     - excludes all non-CEA samples and who *do not* have type 2 diabetes
###                [EXCL_SMOKER]    * exclusion_nonCEA_SMOKER.list     - excludes all non-CEA samples and who are smokers 
###                [EXCL_NONSMOKER] * exclusion_nonCEA_nonSMOKER.list  - excludes all non-CEA samples and who are non-smokers
###                [EXCL_PRE2007]   * exclusion_nonCEA_pre2007.list    - excludes all non-CEA samples and who were included before 2007
###                [EXCL_POST2007]  * exclusion_nonCEA_post2007.list   - excludes all non-CEA samples and who were included after 2007
### - Argument #5  is path_to to the phenotype-file [refer to readme for list of available phenotypes].
### - Argument #6  is path_to to the covariates-file [refer to readme for list of available covariates].
### - Argument #7  is path_to the project [name] directory, where the output should be stored.
### - Argument #8  is the name of the queue to use [veryshort/short/medium/long/verylong] (GWAS require more than 8 hours per chromosome).
### - Argument #9  is your e-mail address; you'll get an email when the jobs have ended or are aborted/killed.

### THIS PART IS SPECIFIC FOR GWAS
### - Argument #10 indicates the type of trait, quantitative or binary [QUANT/BINARY] | QUANT IS THE DEFAULT.
### - Argument #11 is minimum info-score [INFO]."
### - Argument #12 is minimum minor allele count [MAC]."
### - Argument #13 is minimum coded allele frequency [CAF]."
### - Argument #14 is lower/upper limit of the BETA/SE [BETA_SE]."

### THIS PART IS SPECIFIC FOR INDIVIDUAL VARIANT ANALYSES
### - Argument #10 you are running an individual variant list analysis, thus we expect a path_to to the variant-list-file."
### - Argument #11 you are running a regional analysis, thus we expect here [CHR] (e.g. 1-22 or X; NOTE: GoNL4 doesn't include information for chromosome X)."
### - Argument #12 indicates the type of trait, quantitative or binary [QUANT/BINARY] | QUANT IS THE DEFAULT."

### THIS PART IS SPECIFIC FOR REGIONAL ANALYSES
### - Argument #10 you are running a regional analysis, thus we expect here [CHR] (e.g. 1-22 or X; NOTE: GoNL4 doesn't include information for chromosome X).
### - Argument #11 you are running a regional analysis, thus we expect here [REGION_START] (e.g. 12345)
### - Argument #12 you are running a regional analysis, thus we expect here [REGION_END] (e.g. 678910)
### - Argument #13 indicates the type of trait, quantitative or binary [QUANT/BINARY] | QUANT IS THE DEFAULT.
